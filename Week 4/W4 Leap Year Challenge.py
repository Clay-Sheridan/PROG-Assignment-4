'''Challenge: A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4; however, if the year can be evenly divided by 100, it 
is NOT a leap year, unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400 then it is a leap year. Write code that 
asks the user to input a year and output True if itâ€™s a leap year, or False otherwise. Use if statements. '''
